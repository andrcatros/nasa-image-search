# NASA Image Search

This React app allows the user to search for images in the [NASA Images API](https://images-api.nasa.gov/). Simply input a valid search query (e.g. "moon", "Saturn", "space" etc) in the search box and the app will fetch images from the API. If you do not provide a valid search query, the app will display the message _No results found! Please enter a valid search term._

This project is based on learning materials created by [Manchester Codes](https://github.com/MCRcodes) and was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

You can visit the deployed app [here](https://nasa-image-search-43ec2.web.app/).
